# AL-Project---corizo
# Spotify Data Analysis Project 🎵

A comprehensive machine learning project analyzing Spotify music data to predict musical characteristics and discover patterns in audio features.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores Spotify's audio features dataset using various machine learning algorithms to predict musical attributes and understand relationships between different audio characteristics. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model comparison.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

The project implements and compares four different machine learning algorithms:

### 1. Random Forest Regressor
- Ensemble method using multiple decision trees
- Excellent for handling non-linear relationships
- Provides feature importance rankings

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Instance-based learning algorithm
- Effective for pattern recognition in audio features
- Non-parametric approach

### 3. Linear Regression
- Baseline statistical model
- Identifies linear relationships between features
- Interpretable coefficients

### 4. Decision Tree Regressor
- Tree-based algorithm for regression tasks
- Easy to interpret and visualize
- Handles both numerical and categorical features

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using multiple performance metrics:

- **Model Score**: Built-in scoring method (R² for regression)
- **R-squared (R²)**: Coefficient of determination measuring variance explained
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared differences between actual and predicted values

## 📊 Key Features Analyzed

The project analyzes various Spotify audio features including:

- **Acousticness** - Confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic
- **Danceability** - How suitable a track is for dancing
- **Energy** - Perceptual measure of intensity and power
- **Instrumentalness** - Predicts whether a track contains no vocals
- **Liveness** - Detects the presence of an audience in the recording
- **Loudness** - Overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB)
- **Speechiness** - Detects the presence of spoken words
- **Tempo** - Overall estimated tempo in beats per minute (BPM)
- **Valence** - Musical positiveness conveyed by a track

## 📋 Results Summary

The model comparison reveals performance across different algorithms:

| Model | R² Score | MSE | Model Score |
|-------|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Random Forest** | **0.431** | **0.031** | **0.431** |
| Linear Regression | 0.189 | 0.045 | 0.189 |
| KNN | 0.183 | 0.045 | 0.183 |
| Decision Tree | -0.085 | 0.060 | -0.085 |

### 🏆 Performance Analysis

- **🥇 Best Model: Random Forest** with R² = 0.431 (explains 43.1% of variance)
- **🥈 Second Best: Linear Regression** with R² = 0.189 (explains 18.9% of variance)  
- **🥉 Third Place: KNN** with R² = 0.183 (explains 18.3% of variance)
- **⚠️ Poor Performance: Decision Tree** with negative R² = -0.085 (indicates overfitting)

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **🎯 Random Forest Dominates**: Significantly outperforms other models with 43.1% variance explained
- **📊 Model Complexity Trade-off**: Simple Linear Regression performs comparably to complex KNN
- **⚠️ Overfitting Alert**: Decision Tree shows negative R² indicating severe overfitting to training data
- **📈 Ensemble Advantage**: Random Forest's ensemble approach effectively reduces overfitting seen in single Decision Tree
- **🎵 Audio Feature Complexity**: Non-linear relationships in music data favor ensemble methods over linear approaches
- **💡 Prediction Accuracy**: Random Forest achieves lowest MSE (0.031), making it most reliable for predictions
